# Face Recognizer (working on it!)

Welcome to Face Recognizer! This project aims to develop a face recognition system with authentication, interactive frontend design using React and Tachyons, and integration with a machine learning (ML) API.

## Project Overview

Face Recognizer is a web-based application that allows users to upload images containing faces. The application then uses a machine learning API to detect and recognize faces in the uploaded images. It also includes authentication functionality to secure user data and interactions.

## Features

- üõ°Ô∏è **Authentication**: Secure user authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and Express middleware.
- üé® **Frontend Design**: Interactive and visually appealing frontend design using React and Tachyons CSS Toolkit.
- üîç **Face Recognition**: Integration with a machine learning API to recognize faces in uploaded images.
- üì§ **Image Upload**: Ability for users to upload images containing faces for recognition.
- üë§ **User Management**: User profile management and settings.
- üîí **Admin Dashboard** (optional): Administrative interface for managing users, images, and system settings.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js
  - Tachyons CSS Toolkit

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js with Express.js
  - JWT for authentication
  - MySQL for database storage

- **Machine Learning API**:
  - Pre-trained Model for Face Detection and Recognition
  - API Integration (e.g., REST API, SDK)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognizer.git`
2. **Setup Backend**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory and follow instructions in the README.md file to set up the backend server, database, and authentication.
3. **Setup Frontend**:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory and follow instructions in the README.md file to set up the frontend application.
4. **Integrate ML API**:
   - Obtain access to a machine learning API for face detection and recognition.
   - Follow API documentation to integrate it with the backend server for face recognition functionality.
5. **Start the Application**: Start both the backend server and frontend application.
6. **Explore**: Access the application in your web browser and explore its features.

## Usage

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Register for a new account or login with existing credentials.
2. **Upload Image**:
   - Upload an image containing faces using the provided interface.
3. **Face Recognition**:
   - Once the image is uploaded, the system will recognize faces and display them on the screen.
4. **Profile Management**:
   - Update user profile information, change password, or logout.

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Implement real-time face detection using webcam input.
- **Custom Models**: Train custom machine learning models for face recognition.
- **Improved UI/UX**: Continuously improve the frontend design for better user experience.
- **Localization**: Add support for multiple languages and regions.
- **Scalability**: Optimize the system for scalability to handle a large number of users and images.
